        <h2>What is the NCT Chord Project?</h2>
        <p>The NCT Chord Project is a personal project I created over Winter Break (2022-2023), applying skills learned in INFO 3300 (Data Driven Web Applications)
            the semester prior. It is definitally not a finished product, but published to share with others and get insight for further UX and feature improvements. 
            It was inspired by a <a href="https://marykolbas.github.io/public/LinAlgNetworksProj.pdf" target="_blank">short math project</a> 
            completed in Fall 2020 that illustrated a network of (then 18) NCT members and their collaborations on songs. 
        </p>
        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>
            The dataset used behind the scenes of this visualization was made manually using discography and line distribution information from Wikipedia, Spotify, and YouTube.
            This method is prone to human error, so if you find any mistakes regarding the dataset, please let me know! 
        </p>
        <p>The dataset includes songs from debut (NCT U's <em>The 7th Sense</em> released in April 2016) 
            to WayV's 4th EP <em>Phantom</em> released in Dec 2022. The dataset does not include Live Albums (NEO CITY: SEOUL - The Origin, THE DREAM SHOW), <em>Let's Shut Up & Dance</em> (Jason Derulo),
            iScreaM Remixes, or Apple's <em>Up Next Session: NCT 127</em>. SM Station or STATION3 songs were included when more than one NCT member participated on the same track. 
            Some Intros, Outros, and Interludes were ommitted if there is no clear indication of who is speaking.
        The dataset does not double-count rereleased songs on repackaged albums.</p>
        <p>"Full Units" refer to songs released under a particular unit with all active members at that time on the same track. This includes historical lineups, such as NCT 127 with 5 members (<em>Fire Truck</em>), 
        7 members (<em>Limitless</em>), 9 members with WinWin, 9 members with Jungwoo, etc. This rule was applied similarly to NCT DREAM (in regards to Jaemin and Mark's temporary departures) and WayV (WinWin and Lucas). </p>
        <h2>Pre-processing</h2>
        <p>The manually-created CSV has been processed in Python to create the JSON files used in creating the Chord Diagram. This code can be found on
            <a href="https://github.com/marykolbas/nct-chord">Github</a>, along with the CSVs and JSONs used for this visualization.
